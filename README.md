jewelthief
==========

A little Java Swing app to extract objects (images, videos, etc.) from webpages.

I wrote this some years ago to get some experience with Java GUI applications, threads, network connections, etc. It's a bit silly, but might be useful to someone hoping to learn about those things (how to do them, or possibly how _not_ to do them).

###Build

The repo contains a NetBeans (last tested version: 7.1.2) project, and the GUI portions of the code are auto-generated by NetBeans' GUI Swing builder, Matisse. To build, open the project in NetBeans and click `Run > Build Project`. To build on the command line, type `ant jar` in the project's root directory. In either case, the .jar file will be created in the project's `dist/` subdirectory.

###Run

To run, type `java -jar jewelthief.jar`. Downloaded objects will be saved in the current directory, with filenames reflecting the objects' source URLs.
